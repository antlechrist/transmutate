* Keep using lame presets or switch to `-V -n`?
* Switch all tagging programs (id3tag, oggenc, metaflac) to mutagen
  (for id3v2.4 support and sanity's sake)

	$ mutagen-inspect 55\ Necrophagist\ -\ Epitaph\ -\ Stabwound.mp3 | grep TDRC | cut -d \= -f 2
	2010

* It seems there's a LOT of repetition in the functions... Can we
  generalize some of them?

Done :: 2010-07-19
------------------
* Added album_date field to tags
* Fixed wording of some variable questions
